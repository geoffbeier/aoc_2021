# Advent Of Code 2021

These are my solutions for
2021's [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2021). My plan this year is to
use this to get my python as idiomatic as possible, but I may deviate depending
on the size of my timebox for a given day, a whim, impatience, or specific
characteristics of a puzzle that make some other tool on my belt seem better.

Any original code here is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE.md). I
probably won't take the time to vet any dependencies' licenses unless I copy
them into this tree. In the unlikely event something from here is worth copying,
the burden is on the copying party to check the suitability of the licenses for
code that isn't mine.
